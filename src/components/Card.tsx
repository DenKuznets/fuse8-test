                The single most successful anti-smoking measure was a commercial
                in the 1980's. In the commercial, there is a man smoking a
                cigarette. A voice then exclaims "Smoking will kill you."
                Nothing happens, until Chuck Norris blasts through the wall and
                kills the man with a single round house kick.
